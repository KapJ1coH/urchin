I created this design because I wanted to upgrade my Sweep with a pair of nice!view displays. I decided to use the edge design from the Swoop and to make it compatible with Kailh hotswap sockets.  
**This is a strictly wireless-only design, and is only compatible with ZMK / nice!nano.**

> Q: Why is this not just another Sweep?  
*A: In order to support the nice!view display I had to use a switch matrix with diodes instead of the Sweep's direct pin design. This means that the firmwares are not interchangeable. I also wanted to use a different PCB shape which makes it incompatible with Sweep cases.*

## Features
⭕ Design fully optimized for wireless    
⭕ Native nice!view support  
⭕ Familiar Ferris/Sweep layout  
⭕ Improved outline shape  
⭕ Support for Kailh hotswap sockets
